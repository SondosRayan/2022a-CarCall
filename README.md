> this is an application that serves as a platform for drivers to contact each other and ask for help. 

## Motivation
 For many drivers when facing minor problems such as flat tire or running out of fuel, seeking help is inconvenient and may take a long time, when there is probably someone around who can help. For many others contacting with the owners of the cars around is needed in case they are blocking their car or taking their private parking slot. We want to help drivers connect easily, using a simple platform.
